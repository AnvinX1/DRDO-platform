**Problem Statement Title:** Automated Comprehensive Technology Intelligence and Forecasting Platform  
**Organization:** Ministry of Defence (MoD)

## Project Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge faced by DRDO laboratories in managing fragmented and manual approaches to technology intelligence, forecasting, and strategic decision-making. The platform transforms scattered technology data into comprehensive, real-time strategic insights through AI-powered automation.

## Problem Statement

### Background
Laboratories across DRDO struggle with fragmented and manual approaches to technology intelligence, technology forecasting, and strategic decision-making related to technology adoption and development. Present methods used for analyzing technology forecasting include patent analysis, market trends, supplier mapping, and Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessments. The techniques are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often produce outdated insights by the time they reach decision-makers.

### Key Challenges
- **Fragmented Data Sources**: Critical technology information is scattered across multiple databases, publications, and sources
- **Manual Processing Delays**: Most technology intelligence projects experience significant delays due to manual processing
- **Lack of Real-time Monitoring**: Inability to provide continuous monitoring and real-time updates on emerging technologies
- **Specialized Personnel Scarcity**: Difficulty in finding specialized people for comprehensive technology scouting
- **Data Integration Issues**: Difficulty in connecting diverse data sources and analysis methodologies

### Expected Solution
An AI-based automated data aggregation platform that integrates data from:
- Patents across all countries
- Research publications
- Industry reports
- Companies engaged in specific technologies
- Government and private R&D investment data

The solution provides comprehensive data analysis across multiple domains with capabilities for:
- Technology forecasting with TRL progression tracking
- S-curve & Hype curve analysis
- Market size predictions
- Technology convergence detection
- Signal analysis for specific technologies
